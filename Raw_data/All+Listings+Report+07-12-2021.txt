1V-HJUS-V3N3	B01A1938W6	Nutricost Melatonin 5mg, 240 Capsules - Regulate Sleeping Cycle, Non-GMO, Gluten Free, Made in The USA	Melatonin by Nutricost uses only high quality melatonin. Each batch is tested for quality and purity by independent iso-accredited laboratories.<p>There is a lot of research regarding melatonin. Much of this indicates that Melatonin may be associated with the regulation of normal sleep/wake cycles. Nutricost Melatonin brings you 5mg per capsule of only the best, highest quality, melatonin to help you get the sleep you've been wanting!</p> <p>Melatonin is a natural hormone made by your body's pineal gland. This is a very small gland located just above the middle of the brain. During the day the pineal is inactive. When the sun goes down and darkness occurs, the pineal is "turned on" by the SCN and begins to produce melatonin, which is released into the blood. As a result, melatonin levels in the blood rise sharply and you begin to feel less alert. Sleep becomes more inviting. Melatonin levels in the blood stay elevated for about 12 hours - all through the night - before the light of a new day when they fall back to low daytime levels. Daytime levels of melatonin in your body are barely detectable.</p> <p>Bright light directly inhibits the release of melatonin. That is why melatonin is sometimes called the "Dracula of hormones" - it only comes out in the dark. Even if the pineal gland is "switched on" by the clock, it will not produce melatonin unless the person is in a dimly lit environment. Melatonin's release can be prevented by both natural and artificial bright lights.</p>

Nutricost strives to provide the best supplements at the best prices. Please be aware that taking high dosages of Vitamin B3 (Niacin), especially when your body is not used to it, can lead to what is often referred to as the Niacin flush. A "niacin flush" is a temporary side effect of taking niacin; it's also a protocol used by some physicians to lower lipid profiles and boost heart health. Studies have shown that niacin flush has a lot of benefits. However, if you are looking for just the benefits of vitamin b3 without the flush, we'd recommend using a different form of Vitamin b3 such as Niacinamide. The way niacin works is by mobilizing fat cells to release toxins into the blood where they can be removed by the body. The dosage of these capsules is intended to cause this effect for most people. Niacin causes your blood vessels to dilate and creates a sensation of warmth. This is a sign the detoxification effect of niacin is at its peak and will be most effective.
